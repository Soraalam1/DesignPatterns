With a builder we can:

Handle complex constructors (with LOTS of parameters)
Guarantee that the object is immutable (cannot be changed once built)

Examples:
StringBuilder
DocumentBuilder
LocaleBuilder

Multiple constructors with each parameter variation is called a telescoping constructor

Builders are typically written with  static inner class
Calls the appropriate constructor
Negates the need for exposed setters

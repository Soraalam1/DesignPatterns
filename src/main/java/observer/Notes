When a subject has One to Many observers

We are trying to decouple objects generally

This pattern is used in Event Handling capabilities

Publisher/Subscriber

M-V-C where the view is event driven

Examples:
java.util.Observer
java.util.EventListener
java.jms.Topic

The design is that of a subject that needs to be OBSERVED.

The subject is usually an interface or abstract class that we make concrete typically.
Subject implements Obervable interface.

Pieces: Subject, Concrete Subject, Observer, Concrete Observer.
